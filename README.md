# 02-CSS-Bootstrap-Homework

Here, you’ll find a website I build primarily using Bootstrap CSS Frameworks. I’ve included a grid system, background image, nav bar, links and a footer. The links in my nav bar will lead to other pages within the same website. On my portfolio tab, in theory, if projects were truly there, you’d be able to click it and view the project itself.
